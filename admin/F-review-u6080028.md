This is a review on the code written by Aditya Sharma for Task 5 of COMP1110 Assignment two. The code, in short, 
determines the validity of a sequence of piece placements. The code is purely mathematical, somewhat complex 
and yet vey efficient (O(n)).

The best feature about this code is its efficiency and non-hardcoding style, a technique I may have employed had I
written this task instead. Another good feature about it is its mathematical nature and therefore how much easier
it is to debug due to this. For instance, transposing a matrix and mirroring an object (in this instance a matrix) 
always follows the same convention and Adi employed these convention in his code. Following such conventions made it
easy to avoid bugs and if (or when faced), debugging was relatively simple to overcome. 

In terms of documentation, Aditya's code follows and elaborates ideas and concepts we have learned throughout this
semester. The if-statements and loops are all encapsulated by braces as they should be, the switch statements are in
the correct form. The commenting however doesn't follow the Java Documentation. For instance, the slashes are used in 
cases where there are no single-line comments. On top of this the program decomposition is appropriate. Each method is
well broken down and flow smoothly from the previous to the next. 

The code is well formatted and uses appropriate methods where needed. Each method is commented in detail with 
consistency. The methods and variables are also named correctly, following the java convention. All in all, the
code is logically coherent and the loops if-statements and control flows are written in the java convention.
