I submit the following for assessment as my best class.

* The method buildTree() in class StepsGame.
* The method getSolutions() in class StepsGame.
* ...

I declare that this is entirely my own work, with the following documented exceptions:

* The idea of using <normalize> as a mechanism to get rid of ordering issues in tree construction came from a discussion with <Sina Eghbal>

* The code in class <TreeNode> is inspired by <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16229732/cant-wrap-my-head-around-populating-an-n-ary-tree>
